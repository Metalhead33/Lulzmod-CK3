 chaos_religion_desc:1 "At the birth of the Imperium of Man, fully half of the Emperor's most trusted Space Marine Legions turned against him in a bitter civil war known as the Horus Heresy. Brother fought brother, and Mankind stood upon the very brink of extinction in this civil war. After Warmaster Horus was defeated, the fallen Space Marines were banished to the Eye of Terror.\nTen thousand years after their defeat, those same traitors still launch their Black Crusades out of the Eye of Terror, intent upon nothing less then the utter destruction of the Imperium and the death of its weakling Emperor. Now and forever they had become Chaos Space Marines, despised and feared as traitors and heretics throughout the galaxy."
